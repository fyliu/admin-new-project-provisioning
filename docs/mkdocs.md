# MkDocs

This project is set up to enable working with mkdocs pages locally. We're making use of the docker image from [docker-mkdocs](https://github.com/hackforla/docker-mkdocs/) to serve the pages.

See documentation for [how to work on docs locally](https://fyliu.github.io/docker-mkdocs/user-guide/#work-on-docs-locally) in the [docker-mkdocs](https://github.com/hackforla/docker-mkdocs/) repo.

The quick hint is to run this command: `docker-compose up mkdocs`
